# Dog Breed Classification

This project focuses on classifying dog breeds using a deep learning model trained on over 10,000 images. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, we utilized the MobileNet V2 architecture to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in breed identification.

## Features

- **Dataset**: A comprehensive collection of 10,000+ images covering a wide range of dog breeds.
- **Model**: Transfer learning with MobileNet V2, a lightweight and efficient model optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved robust performance in distinguishing between different dog breeds.
- **Scalability**: The model can be extended to include more breeds or adapted for similar classification tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-classification.git
cd dog-breed-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

To classify a new image, use:

```bash
python classify.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
